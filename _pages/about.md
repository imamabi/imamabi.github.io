  I’m Ibrahim Imam, a Ph.D. Candidate in Chemical Engineering at the University of Kentucky, Lexington. My research sits at the dynamic intersection of computational chemistry, molecular simulation, and machine learning, to accelerate molecular discovery.

  Research Focus
I develop hybrid computational pipelines that fuse physics-based molecular mechanics (molecular docking, molecular dynamics, free energy calculations) with modern machine learning (e.g., protein language models, ensemble learning) to solve high-impact problems in materials and drug discovery.

My current work focuses on:
- Discovering functional peptides by integrating protein language models (PLM) with MD simulations — generating functional candidates in silico before wet-lab validation.
- Repurposing FDA-approved drugs via ML-accelerated virtual screening — combining ensemble model predictions with molecular docking and simulation to prioritize high-affinity candidates, and maintain biochemical accuracy without sacrificing mechanistic insight. 

Future Goals 

Beyond my Ph.D., I aim to continue pushing the frontier of AI-augmented molecular science — whether in an industry R&D lab (biotech, pharma, or AI-for-science startups), a national research institution, or a postdoctoral role focused on method development. I’m especially interested in roles that value translational impact: turning computational insight into real-world solutions for drug discovery, protein engineering, or biomolecular design.
